Of course. Let's proceed with **Part 6: Financial Management**, breaking it down step-by-step.

This part is crucial for tracking the money flowing _out_ of the business, which is essential for accurate profitability analysis. We will start with the most direct form of cash outflow: logging general business expenses.

Let's begin with **6.1 Expense Tracking & Categorization**, based on the user story and requirements in PRD Section 6.1.

### **User Flow Diagram: 6.1 Expense Tracking & Categorization**

**Actor:** Manager, Admin

---

#### **Part 1: Logging a New Expense (Manager/Admin Workflow)**

- **1. Start: Navigate to Expenses**
  - The user is logged in.
  - They click on `Expenses` or `Financials -> Expenses` in the main application navigation.
- **2. Expense List Screen**
  - The user is taken to the "Expense List" screen.
  - This screen displays a table of all previously recorded business expenses, with columns for `Date`, `Description`, `Category`, and `Amount`.
  - The list is filterable by `Date Range` and `Expense Category`.
  - A primary button, `[Log New Expense]`, is displayed.
- **3. User Clicks [Log New Expense]**
  - This action opens the "Log New Expense" modal form.
- **4. User Fills Out Expense Form**
  - The user enters the details of the expense as per the PRD:
    - `Expense Description` (e.g., "January Rent", "Electricity Bill")
    - `Amount`
    - `Expense Date` (using a date picker)
    - `Category` (selecting from a dropdown list of predefined categories)
    - `Notes` (optional text area)
- **5. User Clicks [Save Expense]**
- **6. System Validates and Records Expense**
  - The system saves the new expense record. This record will be used in financial reports.
- **7. Confirmation and Return**
  - The modal closes, and the user is returned to the **Expense List Screen (Step 2)**.
  - The newly logged expense is now visible at the top of the list. A success message is shown.
- **End of Part 1.**

#### **Part 2: Managing Expense Categories (Admin-Only Workflow)**

- **1. Start: Navigate to Expense Category Settings**
  - An `Admin` user is on the **Expense List Screen**.
  - There is a `[Manage Categories]` button or link available only to Admins.
- **2. Open Category Management Interface**
  - Clicking the button opens a simple management interface, likely a modal, for expense categories. This interface follows our standard CRUD pattern.
  - It shows a list of existing categories (e.g., "Rent", "Utilities", "Salaries", "Marketing").
  - Each category has `[Edit]` and `[Delete]` buttons.
  - There is an input field and an `[Add Category]` button to create a new one.
- **3. Admin Manages Categories**
  - The Admin can perform CRUD operations:
    - **Create:** Types a new category name and clicks `[Add]`.
    - **Update:** Clicks `[Edit]`, modifies the name in an input field, and clicks `[Save]`.
    - **Delete:** Clicks `[Delete]` and confirms via a pop-up.
- **4. Admin Closes Interface**
  - The Admin closes the modal and returns to the **Expense List Screen**. The dropdown in the "Log New Expense" form will now be updated with the changes.
- **End of Part 2.**
