The Retail Inventory & Finance Manager is a comprehensive, cloud-based web application designed to transform small to mid-sized retail businesses in Uzbekistan from inefficient, paper-based operations to a streamlined digital platform.

The application will provide an all-in-one solution for managing the core pillars of a retail business:

- **Financial Management:** Simple tools for tracking sales, expenses, customer debts, and supplier payments to provide a clear view of profitability.

By automating manual processes and centralizing data, the application will empower business owners with the visibility and control needed to reduce waste, optimize sales, and drive sustainable growth.
