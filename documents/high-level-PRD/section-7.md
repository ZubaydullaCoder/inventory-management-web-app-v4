Of course. This final section is where all the data we've meticulously defined comes together to provide real value to the user. It focuses on presenting information in a clear, digestible, and actionable format.

### **7.0 Dashboard, Reports & Analytics**

This module is the primary interface for business intelligence. It consolidates data from all other modules into a high-level dashboard for quick insights and detailed reports for in-depth analysis.

#### **7.1 Main Dashboard**

The Dashboard is the first screen the user sees after logging in. It must provide an immediate, at-a-glance overview of the business's current state and highlight areas that require attention.

- **User Story:** "As a business owner, when I log in, I want to see a summary of my key business metrics and any urgent issues, like items running out of stock, so I can know exactly what to focus on today."

- **Layout:** The dashboard will be a collection of widgets that are loaded by default.

- **Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Widgets:** These are prominent boxes displaying single, important numbers for a selected time period (e.g., "Today", "This Month").

  - `Total Revenue`
  - `Net Profit`
  - `Total Expenses`
  - `Number of Sales`
  - `Total Accounts Receivable` (Money owed by customers)
  - `Total Accounts Payable` (Money owed to suppliers)

- **Visual Charts:**

  - **Sales Over Time:** A line or bar chart displaying daily or weekly sales revenue for the last 30 days. This helps visualize trends.
  - **Top-Selling Products:** A bar chart or list showing the top 5 products by revenue or quantity sold for the current month.
  - **Sales by Category:** A pie chart showing the breakdown of sales revenue by product category for the current month.

- **Actionable Alerts:** These are lists designed to prompt immediate action.
  - **Low Stock Alerts:** A list of all products whose `Current Stock Quantity` is at or below their `Low Stock Threshold`. Each item should be a link to the product's page.
  - **Expiring Products Alerts:** A list of products that are expired or will expire within a set timeframe (e.g., the next 30 days). This is critical for minimizing waste.

#### **7.2 Standard Reports**

These are detailed, data-heavy pages accessible from the main navigation, allowing `Managers` and `Admins` to perform deeper analysis. All reports must be filterable by date range and exportable to CSV.

##### **7.2.1 Sales Report**

- **Purpose:** To provide a detailed, line-by-line breakdown of all sales.
- **Columns:** `Transaction ID`, `Date/Time`, `Product(s) Sold`, `Quantity`, `Price per Item`, `Discount Applied`, `Total Sale Amount`, `Cashier`, `Customer`.
- **Filters:** Date Range, Cashier, Customer, Product Category.

##### **7.2.2 Profit & Loss (P&L) Statement**

- **Purpose:** To provide a clear financial summary of the business's profitability over a selected period.
- **Structure:** A standard P&L format:
  - **Income:**
    - `Total Revenue`
  - **Less: Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):**
    - `Total COGS`
  - **= Gross Profit**
  - **Less: Operating Expenses:**
    - A line item for each `Expense Category` (Rent, Salaries, etc.)
    - `Total Expenses`
  - **= Net Profit**
- **Filters:** Date Range (e.g., "Last Month", "Last Quarter", "Custom Range").

##### **7.2.3 Inventory Report**

- **Purpose:** To give a detailed overview of the current state and value of all inventory.
- **Columns:** `Product Name`, `SKU`, `Category`, `Supplier`, `Current Stock Quantity`, `Cost Price`, `Selling Price`, `Total Stock Value (Quantity * Cost Price)`.
- **Filters:** Category, Supplier.
- **Additional Features:** This report should have a button to quickly identify "dead stock" (items that haven't sold in a long time, e.g., > 90 days).

##### **7.2.4 Expense Report**

- **Purpose:** To provide a simple, detailed list of all logged business expenses.
- **Columns:** `Expense Date`, `Description`, `Category`, `Amount`.
- **Filters:** Date Range, Expense Category.

This completes the core functional requirements for the application. We have now defined the entire user journey, from initial setup and user management to inventory, sales, financials, and finally, reporting.

The next logical step would be to move to **Section 8.0: Advanced Features & Future Enhancements**, where we can list features like multi-store support and SMS notifications that could be built after the core product is launched. Or, we can begin prioritizing these defined features into a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** release plan.
